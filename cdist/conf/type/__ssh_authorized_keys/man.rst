cdist-type__ssh_authorized_keys(7)
==================================

NAME
----
cdist-type__ssh_authorized_keys - Manage ssh authorized_keys files


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Adds or removes ssh keys from a authorized_keys file.

This type uses the __ssh_dot_ssh type to manage the directory containing
the authorized_keys file. You can disable this feature with the --noparent
boolean parameter.

The existence, ownership and permissions of the authorized_keys file itself are
also managed. This can be disabled with the --nofile boolean parameter. It is
then left to the user to ensure that the file exists and that ownership and
permissions work with ssh.


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
-------------------
key
   the ssh key which shall be added to this authorized_keys file.
   Must be a string.

   Can be specified multiple times. Either --key or --keyfile must be
   specified.

keyfile
   A file containing one or more SSH keys (one per line, just like the
   regular authorized_keys file).

   Can be specified multiple times. Either --key or --keyfile must be
   specified.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
-------------------
comment
   explicit comment instead of the one which may be trailing the given key

file
   an alternative destination file, defaults to ~$owner/.ssh/authorized_keys

option
   an option to set for all created authorized_key entries.
   Can be specified multiple times.
   See sshd(8) for available options.

owner
   the user owning the authorized_keys file, defaults to object_id.

state
   if the given keys should be 'present' or 'absent', defaults to 'present'.


BOOLEAN PARAMETERS
------------------

   don't create or change ownership and permissions of the directory containing
   the authorized_keys file

nofile
   don't manage existence, ownership and permissions of the the authorized_keys
   file

    # add your ssh key to remote root's authorized_keys file
    __ssh_authorized_keys root \
       --key "$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"

    # allow key to login as user-name
    __ssh_authorized_keys user-name \
       --key "ssh-rsa AXYZAAB3NzaC1yc2..."

    # allow key to login as user-name with options and expicit comment

       --comment 'backup server'

    # same as above, but with explicit owner and two keys
    # note that the options are set for all given keys
