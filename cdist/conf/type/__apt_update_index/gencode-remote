# There are special arguments to apt(8) to prevent aborts if apt woudn't been
# updated after the 19th April 2021 till the bullseye release. The additional
# arguments acknoledge the happend suite change (the apt(8) update does the
# same by itself).
#
# Using '-o $config' instead of the --allow-releaseinfo-change-* parameter
# allows backward compatablility to pre-buster Debian versions.
