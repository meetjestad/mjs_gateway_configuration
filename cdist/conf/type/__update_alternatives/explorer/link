# fedora's (update-)alternatives --display output doesn't have
# "link <name> is <path>" line, but debian does. so, let's find
# out how they store this information.
#
# debian and friends:
#   https://salsa.debian.org/dpkg-team/dpkg/-/blob/master/utils/update-alternatives.c
#   see calls to altdb_print_line function
#
# fedora and friends:
#   https://github.com/fedora-sysv/chkconfig/blob/master/alternatives.c
#   see calls to parseLine function
#
# conclusion: it is safe to assume that (master) link is on second line
